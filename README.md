To run the program, you must first create a directory name 'programs' and give it read/write access: ```chmod 777 programs```

This project uses some libraries to run, such as PySWIP and BeautifulSoup, so you may need to install them.

In order to load a program, you must supply the url for a webpage that contains LogicWeb code. Sample pages are provided, but a loadable page must contain an html element containing the property ```lw_code```.
